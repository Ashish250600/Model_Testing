# Model_Testing
In the following code, we have tested various ML models such as LogisticRegression, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, KNeighborsClassifier, GaussianNB and SVC. A dataset is later given to each model and trained. A test dataset was used to test the accuacy of predictions of each model. And SVC model was able to predict with high accuracy than other models.
